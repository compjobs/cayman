Welcome to **The Second International Workshop on Computational Jobs Marketplace** to be held as part of [**The 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence**](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/).

*  **Date**:  March 4, 2025
*  **Location**: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA

Online job marketplaces such as Indeed.com, ZipRecruiter, CareerBuilder and LinkedIn Inc. help millions of job seekers find their next job. These platforms also provide services for thousands of employers to fill their opening positions. With all players in the ecosystem, the market size of this industry is projected to steadily grow and reach $43 billion dollars in 2027. On top of that, the global pandemic COVID-19 in 2020 and the emerging AI trends have profoundly transformed workplaces and the online jobs marketplace, creating and driving new types of jobs and marketplace technologies around the world. Today, online job marketplaces play a central role in this new wave of digital revolution of workforce and workplaces. While this industry generates tremendous growth in the past several years, technological innovations around this industry have yet to come. Many technologies, such as search systems, recommender systems as well as advertising systems that the industry heavily relies on are deeply rooted in their more generic counterparts, which may not address the unique challenges in this industry for better products serving both job seekers and employers/recruiters.

This workshop would play a critical role to bring together the research and development community in this industry especially around data science and machine learning and facilitate innovations on theories, models, systems and practices in this currently scattered community. An expected outcome of the workshop is to create awareness of this emerging industry with its technological opportunities and challenges, which might foster future research and development, creating novel products to serve future job seekers and employers/recruiters.
