Welcome to **The First International Workshop on Computational Jobs Marketplace** to be held as part of [**The 15th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2022)**](https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2022/).

*  **Date**: Feb 25, 2022
*  **Location**: Tempe Mission Palms Hotel and Conference Center in Tempe, Arizona

Online job marketplaces such as Indeed.com, CareerBuilder and LinkedIn Inc. have been helping millions of job seekers find their next jobs and thousands of corporations as well as institutions fill their opening positions. Along with the increase of market size, there has been a lot of interesting challenges in this domain, such as the drastic increase of work from home or remote work, the imbalance between the demand and supply of the job market, the popularity of independent workers, the capability of helping job seekers on their whole job seeking journey and career development, the different objectives and behaviors of all major stakeholders in the ecosystem, e.g. job seekers, employers, recruiters and job agents, to name just a few.

This workshop brings academic researchers and industry practitioners together to share early research results. We focus on the state of the art advances in the computational jobs marketplace.
