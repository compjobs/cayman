**<span style="color:red">Want to attend the event?</span>** [Join with Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83646183992?pwd=NUYyRHBCZ2ZkOGNCN091M2xoYzMvdz09).

*  **Date**: 1:25PM -- 5:00PM **Mountain Standard Time**, Feb 25, 2022
*  **Location**: [Zoom Link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83646183992?pwd=NUYyRHBCZ2ZkOGNCN091M2xoYzMvdz09)

Online job marketplaces such as Indeed.com, CareerBuilder and LinkedIn Inc. have been helping millions of job seekers find their next jobs and thousands of corporations as well as institutions fill their opening positions. Along with the increase of market size, there has been a lot of interesting challenges in this domain, such as the drastic increase of work from home or remote work, the imbalance between the demand and supply of the job market, the popularity of independent workers, the capability of helping job seekers on their whole job seeking journey and career development, the different objectives and behaviors of all major stakeholders in the ecosystem, e.g. job seekers, employers, recruiters and job agents, to name just a few.

This workshop brings academic researchers and industry practitioners together to share early research results. We focus on the state of the art advances in the computational jobs marketplace.

# KEYNOTE SPEAKERS

[**Wenjing Zhang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenjingzhang/) is a Sr Director of Data for Talent Solutions at LinkedIn, where she leads a team of 100+ data scientists and ML engineers across the globe. The work from her team powers the products that millions of people rely on to find a job, learn new skills, and hire the right talent in an efficient and equitable manner. As a veteran in LinkedIn, she has witnessed, initiated, and participated in many transformations through data innovation across consumer and enterprise spaces over the past decade. Prior to LinkedIn, she has worked as a data scientist for several years in eBay and JPMorgan Chase.

**Talk Title: Our Journey to #Remote Work.**

**Talk Abstract**: Job changing has dramatically increased since Covid, a phenomenon we call the #GreatReshuffle.  This unprecedented moment in the history of has many of us rethink how we work. Working remotely is on employers' and job seekers' minds. In this talk, we will present how LinkedIn uses AI and Data Science to adapt to this new trend and our learnings from the journey so far. Given how essential work location is in the job marketplaces, this case study on remote jobs will allow us to peek into our measurement framework and AI system.

He’s been “helping people get jobs” at Indeed for the past six years. Previous to this, he worked on Search and Ad ranking problems at Google. He estimates that if Indeed keeps growing at its current rate, we’ll employ over 50% of the world’s workforce by 2040, just after civilization collapses because of the Year 2038 Problem. Until then, though, Donal is going to use math, science and software to help millions of people make smarter, faster and geekier employment decisions.

**Talk Title: Unsolved Mysteries in the Online Jobs Marketplace - Unique market characteristics, Open problems and Potential Solution Paths.**

**Talk Abstract**: Online marketplaces have flourished in recent years; as people engage with ride-sharing apps, dating sites and vacation rental platforms. In this session we ask, “what’s unique about the computational labor marketplace?”. We’ll outline differentiating characteristics such as information asymmetry, signal delay, incomplete data, and risk aversion due to high stakes. In addition, macro-economic employment patterns are evolving rapidly. New perspectives are emerging on early/no retirement, remote worki, and secondary gig roles. Covid-19 has accelerated this change. These conditions provide a rich set of novel unsolved problems. We’ll introduce three fundamental challenges we encounter at Indeed, spanning (i) structural missing data patterns, (ii) measurement limitations, and (iii) machine learning model tethering. We’ll discuss partial solution paths, and challenge attendees to contribute in “helping people get jobs”.
